# Frontend

The frontend, as shown in the diagram, was developed using the <a href="https://nextjs.org">Nextjs</a> framework, which is based on the <a href="https://react.dev">Reactjs</a> library for creating functional components and other features.

## Style

To style all components of the site, the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">tailwindcss</a> framework was used, which is a css framework that provides numerous ready-to-use and easy-to-manipulate style classes.
